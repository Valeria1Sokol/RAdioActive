                        <p>Marie was more than a brilliant mind. She was a humanitarian who wanted her science to save lives. When the First World War broke out, Marie put her work on hold. Her precious supply of radium was stored in a lead-lined container and hidden in a bank vault, to be collected again later. Instead she dedicated herself to designing the ‘radiological car’ – a portable X-ray unit for army surgeons to use on the battlefield. These life-saving vehicles became known as ‘Little Curies’. X-rays revolutionised battlefield care by helping to guide surgeries, locating broken bones and foreign objects like bullets and shrapnel. This reduced the need for amputations. Marie recruited women to donate vehicles and to operate the machines. She even went to the front line herself to operate her own ‘Little Curie’. Thanks to her, more than a million wounded soldiers received X-rays during the war. But there was a cost: in the rush to send help to the front line, there was no time for safety precautions. The effects of exposure to X-rays weren’t fully understood yet, and many volunteers – including Marie herself – later fell ill from the effects.</p>
